AI Community SOP
-
I have developed a very keen interest in AI and ML in a very short time. I was quite afraid of coding one year ago, but after spending this past year at insti, learning from my peers, participating in competitions, and applying for recruitment assignments, I have gained some exposure to AI/ML. It struck me how easily AIs can do things that take so much time for humans. It really fascinates me, and that drives my motivation to learn this field in greater depth. For now, I have decided to gradually shift my career toward AI/ML and build a future in it. I think that's the highest level of motivation one could get in insti—I put AI/ML even above my core branch, which I think is the root of my motivation.

I have learned what I know so far from various sources. I picked up the basics of AI/ML during my work in the driverless subdivision of the Racing team, which I am a part of. I have spent many hours strengthening my coding skills and learning PyTorch, TensorFlow, neural networks, CNNs, and many other things. I’ll admit my level of knowledge grew significantly while attempting this assignment. I learned many new things, but more than that, I cemented my understanding of core AI concepts. Topics like vector embeddings, how data is really processed, and how the machine learns—these are things I’ve gained immense clarity on in the last few weeks.

My goal in joining the AI community is to build a stronger foundation in AI/ML, contribute to the team's projects, participate in hackathons, and be part of the team’s overall growth—as well as that of my peers and, of course, myself.

I do have a good grasp of the basics and a great learning pace, which allows me to learn faster than some LLMs! So I can comprehend concepts quickly and implement them thoroughly for any competition or project. Strong communication skills, leadership qualities, and adaptive teamwork skills will allow me to blend in with the team and contribute to the progress of all of us.
