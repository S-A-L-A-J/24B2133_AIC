AI Community SOP
-
I have developed a very keen interest in AI and ML in a very short time, i was quite afraid of coding 1 year ago, but spending this 1 year at insti and learning from my peers and participating in competitions and applying
for recruitment assignments, i have gained some exposure to AI/ML and it struck me very hard how easily AIs do things that take so much of time. It really fascinates me and that drives my motivation to learn this field
in greater depth. For the time being i have decided to gradually shift my career towards AI/ML and build a career in it, i think that's the highest level of motivation one could get in insti, i put AI/ML even above my core 
branch, which i think is the core of my motivation.

I have learnt what i have until now from various different sources, i learnt the basics of AI/ML during my work at the driverless subdivision of Racing team, which i am a part of. I have spent many hours strengthening my
coding skills and learning the Pytorch, Tensorflow, Neural Networks, CNNs, and many other things. I will admit my level of knowledge grew very much while attempting this assignment and i learnt many new things while 
doing this but, more than that i cemented some of my understandings and core concepts behind AI. Some things like vector embeddings and how the data is really being processed and how the machine learns, these are some
topics about which i have gained immense clarity about during the last few weeks. My goal of joining the AI community is to build a stronger base of AI/ML and contribute to the team's projects, participate in hackathons 
and be a part of the growth of the team as a whole, as well as my peers and of course me. 

I do have a good grasp on the basics and a great learning pace which allows me to learn faster than some LLMs! So, i can comprehend concepts fast and learn them for any competition or any project and implement it
thoroughly. Strong communication skills, leadership qualities and adaptive team working skills would allow me to blend in with the team and contribute to the progress of all of us.
