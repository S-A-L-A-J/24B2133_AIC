      "Role in Business: \n",
      "Marketing management involves understanding customer needs and preferences and then \n",

      "create value for customers while achieving the organization’s objectives, such as increasing \n",
      "market share, revenue, and profitability. \n",
      "Key Concepts and Examples: \n",
      "Market Research: \n",
      "Example: Before launching the iPhone, Apple conducted extensive market research to \n",
      "understand consumer needs for mobile devices. This research revealed a demand for a device \n",
      "that combined communication, entertainment, and computing capabilities, leading to the \n",
      "development of the iPhone. \n",
      "Impact: Market research helps companies like Apple anticipate trends and stay ahead of \n",
